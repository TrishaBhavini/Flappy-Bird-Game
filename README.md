# Flappy Bird Game

This is a **Flappy Bird** game developed by following [this YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM?si=vZhHUgiJ8VPuVfEk), with some modifications to the dimensions to better suit personal preferences. The game is a simple side-scrolling endless runner where the player controls a bird trying to fly between pipes without colliding.

## 📋 Features

- Classic **Flappy Bird** mechanics — tap/flap to keep the bird in the air.
- Endless gameplay with randomly generated pipes.
- Score counter to track progress.
- Basic collision detection.

## 🐛 Known Bugs

- **Score Increment After Game Over:** In some cases, the score may continue to increase even after the bird has collided and the game is over.
- **Bird Fit on Screen:** When flapping too high or too low, the bird might partially leave the screen boundaries.
